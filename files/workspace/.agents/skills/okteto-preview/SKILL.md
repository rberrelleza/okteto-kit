  Okteto Preview Environment skill. Use when someone wants a live, shareable
  environment for a branch or pull request — "deploy a preview for this PR",
  "give me a URL for branch X", posting a preview link back to a PR or thread —
  or when setting up PR preview automation in CI (GitHub Actions or GitLab).
  Use alongside the `okteto` skill: for editing, syncing, and iterating on code,
  defer to that skill's dev environments. Requires an Okteto context; previews
  are an Okteto Platform feature.

# Okteto Preview Environments Skill

A **Preview Environment** is a live, production-like instance of the application deployed from a **git branch**, usually tied to the lifecycle of a pull request. Okteto deploys it into a dedicated namespace named after the preview and gives you shareable URLs, so reviewers, PMs, and stakeholders can click through real functionality without any local setup.

This skill covers two jobs that meet in one ownership model: **driving previews directly** with the CLI (deploy a branch, hand back the URL) and **authoring the CI automation** that owns previews per-PR. Before touching a preview, know which of the two owns it — that decides who redeploys it, who posts its URL, and who tears it down.

## Operating rules

1. **Previews deploy from the pushed branch, not your working tree.** `okteto preview deploy` clones the repository at `--branch` and deploys that. Local uncommitted changes never reach a preview. Committing and pushing the developer's work is **their** call — in collaborative mode, show what's uncommitted and confirm before committing or pushing anything on their behalf. In autonomous mode, push the task branch you own before deploying.
2. **Always name the preview explicitly** (e.g. `pr-1234`), and make it a valid name (see [Naming previews](#naming-previews)). Redeploying with the same name updates the same preview; omitting the name generates a random one that CI and cleanup jobs can never find again.
3. **Use a preview to share, a namespace to work.** Iterating on code belongs in a dev environment (`okteto` skill). A preview is the artifact you hand to reviewers — it has no file sync and no dev containers of yours attached.
4. **Never destroy a preview you did not create.** Same doctrine as the `okteto` skill's cleanup rules: a preview you created for your own task is yours to destroy; shared/global previews and CI-owned previews are not (see [Cleanup and teardown](#cleanup-and-teardown)).
5. **In CI, the pipeline owns the lifecycle.** Deploy on PR open/update, destroy on PR close — via `okteto/deploy-preview` and `okteto/destroy-preview` (GitHub) or `okteto preview deploy`/`destroy` jobs (GitLab).

## Preview vs. namespace: which environment does this task need?

Both give you an isolated, deployed copy of the application. They answer different questions:

| | Dev environment (namespace) | Preview Environment |
|---|---|---|
| Deploys from | Your local working tree (`okteto deploy`) | A pushed git branch (server-side clone) |
| Lifecycle | Yours — lives as long as the work does | A pull request — created on open, destroyed on close |
| Audience | You / the agent doing the work | Reviewers, PMs, stakeholders, the PR thread |
| File sync / `okteto up` | Yes — iterate live | No — redeploy by pushing to the branch |
| Where it shows up | Namespaces in the Okteto dashboard | Previews section of the dashboard, with repo/branch/PR links |
| Created by | `okteto namespace create` + `okteto deploy` | `okteto preview deploy` (CLI or CI) |

Decision guide:

- **"Fix this, test this, debug this"** → dev environment in a namespace. Follow the `okteto` skill.
- **"Give me / the team a link to see branch X or PR Y"** → preview environment.
- **Ticket-to-PR flows use both**: do the work in a namespace dev environment, push the branch, open the PR — then deploy a preview *from the pushed branch* and post its URL on the PR. The namespace is your workbench; the preview is the deliverable reviewers click.

## Deploying a preview

Previews deploy the code Okteto clones from the repository — so push first:

```bash
git push -u origin <branch>
okteto preview deploy pr-1234 --branch <branch> --wait
```

Key flags (see the [quick reference](#cli-quick-reference) for the full list):

- **`--scope personal|global`** — defaults to **`global`**: accessible to all members of the organization. Use `personal` for experiments only you (and people you explicitly share with) should see. Don't assume personal is the default — it isn't. Sharing a personal preview with specific people happens on its dashboard page (`/previews/<name>`), not through the CLI, and only the owner or an admin can share it.
- **`--branch <branch>`** — defaults to the current branch of the checkout you run from.
- **`--repository <url>`** — defaults to the current repo's remote URL. Pass it explicitly when deploying a repo you don't have checked out.
- **`--var KEY=VALUE`** — injects a variable into the manifest's deploy commands. Repeat the flag for multiple variables.
- **`--sourceUrl <pr-url>`** — the HTTPS URL of the pull/merge request; links the PR in the dashboard's Previews list.
- **`--timeout`** — defaults to `5m0s`. Raise it for large stacks (`-t 15m`).
- **`--file`** — path to the Okteto Manifest if it isn't at the default location.

### Naming previews

The preview name becomes the namespace name, so it must be a valid RFC 1123 DNS label: at most 63 characters; lowercase letters, digits, and `-` only; starting **and** ending with a letter or digit (regex `^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?$`). No uppercase, dots, or underscores, and avoid the reserved `kube-` prefix. Derive a safe slug from a branch the same way the `okteto` skill derives namespace names:

```bash
slug=$(git branch --show-current | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sed 's/[^a-z0-9]/-/g; s/^-*//; s/-*$//' | cut -c1-50)
```

Conventions:

- **PR-keyed** (GitHub): `pr-<number>` — stable across pushes to the PR, easy for the cleanup job to find.
- **Branch-keyed** (GitLab): `review-<branch-slug>` — e.g. `review-$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG`, one preview per branch.

**Getting the PR number:** in CI it's in the event (`${{ github.event.number }}`); on a checked-out branch, `gh pr view --json number --jq .number`. If the PR doesn't exist yet, don't invent a number — use a branch-keyed name, or open the PR first and deploy the preview after.

If you omit the name, the CLI generates a random one. Fine for a quick manual experiment; wrong everywhere else — a redeploy creates a *second* preview instead of updating the first.

## Capturing endpoints and posting the URL back

After a successful deploy, capture the endpoints:

```bash
okteto preview endpoints pr-1234            # JSON (default) — parse programmatically
okteto preview endpoints pr-1234 -o md      # Markdown — made for pasting into a PR comment
```

The dashboard page for a preview lives at `https://<your-okteto-url>/previews/<name>`.

**Posting to the PR with `gh`** (when you deployed the preview yourself, outside CI):

```bash
gh pr comment 1234 --body "$(cat <<EOF
Preview environment ready — [dashboard](https://<your-okteto-url>/previews/pr-1234)

$(okteto preview endpoints pr-1234 -o md)
EOF
)"
```

**Posting to a thread** (Slack, ticket, chat): same content — the endpoints from `-o md` plus the dashboard link. The whole point of a preview is that anyone in the thread can click the same URL.

**In CI you usually don't need to post at all**: the `okteto/deploy-preview` GitHub Action posts the URL and endpoints as a PR comment automatically when the `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var is set. Don't add a second `gh pr comment` step on top of it.

## Previews in CI

### GitHub Actions: `okteto/deploy-preview`

The canonical pair of workflows — deploy on PR open/update, destroy on close:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/preview.yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: false   # never true — cancelling an in-progress deploy leaves the preview inconsistent

jobs:
  preview:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Context
        uses: okteto/context@latest
        with:
          url: ${{ secrets.OKTETO_CONTEXT }}
          token: ${{ secrets.OKTETO_TOKEN }}

      - name: Deploy preview environment
        uses: okteto/deploy-preview@latest
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}   # enables the automatic PR comment with the URL
        with:
          name: pr-${{ github.event.number }}
          timeout: 15m
```

```yaml
# .github/workflows/preview-closed.yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - closed

jobs:
  closed:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Context
        uses: okteto/context@latest
        with:
          url: ${{ secrets.OKTETO_CONTEXT }}
          token: ${{ secrets.OKTETO_TOKEN }}

      - name: Destroy preview environment
        uses: okteto/destroy-preview@latest
        with:
          name: pr-${{ github.event.number }}   # must match the deploy workflow's name exactly
```

Repository secrets required: `OKTETO_CONTEXT` (the URL of the Okteto instance, e.g. `https://okteto.example.com`) and `OKTETO_TOKEN` (an Okteto Admin Access Token). `GITHUB_TOKEN` is populated by GitHub automatically.

`okteto/deploy-preview` inputs: `name` (required), `scope` (default `global`), `variables` (comma-separated `VAR1=VAL1,VAR2=VAL2`), `file`, `branch` (defaults to the branch that triggered the action), `timeout`, `log-level`, `dependencies`, `labels` (comma-separated).

### GitLab CI/CD

Same shape with the CLI directly (image `ghcr.io/okteto/okteto:latest`): a `review` job runs `okteto preview deploy review-$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG --branch $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME --repository $CI_PROJECT_URL`, and a `stop-review` job runs `okteto preview destroy review-$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG` when the branch is deleted or the MR merges. Pass the preview URL via the job's `environment.url` so reviewers can open it from GitLab.

---

## Inspecting, sleeping, and waking previews

```bash
okteto preview list                    # status and scope of your previews (-o json|yaml)
okteto preview list --label team-a     # filter by label
okteto preview sleep pr-1234           # scale it down to save resources (owner or admin only)
okteto preview wake pr-1234            # bring a sleeping preview back
```

Sleeping keeps the preview and its configuration; waking restores it. Prefer `sleep` over `destroy` when the goal is saving resources on a preview someone may still need. Admins can also mark a preview **Persistent** in the dashboard, which exempts it from automatic sleep and garbage collection — that's a dashboard action, not a CLI one.

Applications can detect they're running in a preview via the `OKTETO_IS_PREVIEW_ENVIRONMENT=true` environment variable — useful when the task is "make the app behave differently in previews".

## Cleanup and teardown

`okteto preview destroy <name>` runs any `destroy` commands in the Okteto Manifest, then removes the preview and its namespace. It is destructive — the same authorization doctrine as the `okteto` skill applies.

**Decide who owns teardown when you create the preview.** If the repo has preview workflows, prefer opening the PR and letting CI own the whole lifecycle, teardown included. If you deploy ad hoc for a PR, teardown rides on the PR: destroy the preview yourself when the PR closes if you're still running; otherwise say so where you posted the URL — "this preview is not destroyed automatically; after the PR closes, run `okteto preview destroy <name>`". Sleep and the platform's garbage collection are a resource backstop, not an owner.

| Situation | May the agent destroy it? |
|---|---|
| Preview the agent created this session for its own task | **Yes** — yours to tear down when the work is done and the URL is no longer needed |
| CI-owned preview (e.g. `pr-<number>` managed by workflows) | **No** — the close-PR workflow owns teardown. Destroying it mid-review breaks the link reviewers are using |
| Global preview created by someone else | **Never** without explicit instruction |
| Someone else's personal preview | **Never** — and only admins or the owner could anyway |

- In **collaborative mode**, surface the command and let the developer run it: "To tear down the preview, run: `okteto preview destroy pr-1234`".
- In **autonomous mode**, a preview you created this session is yours to destroy once the task no longer needs it — the same "you created it, you own its teardown" rule as the `okteto` skill's worktree namespaces. One caveat: if you posted its URL to a PR or thread, reviewers may still be using it — leave it running (or `okteto preview sleep <name>`) and report the teardown command instead. For any preview you did **not** create, destroy only with explicit authorization, a documented cleanup policy, or pipeline ownership of this run.
- **Don't use `destroy` as a retry.** A failed or stale preview is fixed by redeploying with the same name — `okteto preview deploy <name>` updates in place.

## CLI quick reference

| Command | Collaborative | Autonomous | Purpose |
|---------|:---:|:---:|---------|
| `okteto preview deploy <name>` | Agent | Agent | Deploy a preview from a pushed branch |
| `okteto preview endpoints <name>` | Agent | Agent | List preview URLs (`-o json` default, `-o md` for PR comments) |
| `okteto preview list` | Agent | Agent | Status and scope of your previews |
| `okteto preview sleep <name>` | Agent (own) | Agent (own) | Scale down a preview you own |
| `okteto preview wake <name>` | Agent | Agent | Wake a sleeping preview |
| `okteto preview destroy <name>` | User (or self-created) | Self-created / with policy | Tear down a preview and its namespace |

`okteto preview deploy` flags: `-b/--branch` (default: current branch), `--repository` (default: current repo), `-s/--scope personal|global` (default: `global`), `-v/--var KEY=VALUE` (repeatable), `--sourceUrl <pr-url>`, `-t/--timeout` (default `5m0s`), `-w/--wait` (default `true`), `-f/--file`, `--label` (repeatable), `--dependencies`.

## Common mistakes to avoid

- **Expecting local changes in the preview.** Previews deploy from the pushed branch. Commit and push before `okteto preview deploy`, and push again to update it.
- **Omitting the preview name in CI.** A nameless deploy gets a random name, so every run creates a new preview and the cleanup job orphans them all. Key the name to the PR (`pr-<number>`) or branch slug.
- **Mismatched names between deploy and destroy workflows.** The destroy job must use the exact same name expression as the deploy job, or previews leak.
- **Assuming `--scope` defaults to `personal`.** The default is `global` — visible to the whole organization. Say `--scope personal` when the work isn't ready to share.
- **Using a preview as a dev environment.** No file sync, no `okteto up`. To iterate on code, use a namespace dev environment (`okteto` skill) and keep the preview for reviewers.
- **Running `okteto endpoints` instead of `okteto preview endpoints <name>`.** The former targets the active namespace of your context, not the preview.
- **Setting `cancel-in-progress: true` on the preview workflow.** Cancelling an in-progress deploy leaves the preview inconsistent and leaks resources. Queue per-PR with `cancel-in-progress: false`.
- **Double-posting the URL in CI.** With `GITHUB_TOKEN` set, `okteto/deploy-preview` already comments on the PR. Add your own `gh pr comment` only when deploying from outside CI.
- **Destroying a preview you don't own.** CI-owned, shared/global, or someone else's previews are off-limits without explicit instruction — same rule as `okteto destroy` in the `okteto` skill.
- **Destroying to "fix" a broken preview.** Redeploy with the same name instead; it updates in place.
